## User Stories

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [ ] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Since I have never worked with Swift before, it was difficult to understand the syntax. Also, adding the slider was slightly difficult but I was able to find resources that could aid in my understanding. 

I also had a lot of difficult with the navigation/settings. I wanted to use the navigation and settings so I could change the currency, but the program continued to say error. I also wanted to create a button and another view controller where I could show past information the user wants to save, so they know what they spent and on what day, but I was having difficulty figuring it out.

Because I only know python and the large difference between the two, if I made a tiny incorrect edit, I had trouble going back thus forcing me to redo the project about two times.
